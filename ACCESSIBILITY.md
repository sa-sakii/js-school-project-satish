Improved and updated the whole project to be accesibible by everyone. The goal was to meet the WCAG AA Level requirements.

1. Using semantic HTML tags like <header>, <section>, <article>, <nav> and so on, to maintain proper structure of the page and making it easy for screen reading tools. 
2. Follwing the proper order of the heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>,... <h5>) 
3. Wrapped most of the tags with ARIA roles such as role="navigation" for <nav> tag and role="dialog" for other modal divs.
4. Provided proper labeling to tags with the aria-label attribute.
5. Made it possible to switch and cycle through the <a> tags and button with tab key by focus trapping. 
6. Verified text and background color combinations against WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio.
